# Crash Prediction in Chicago

The idea of this project is to design a predictive model that can tell us if any vehicle crash could occur based on the area, weather, lightning conditions
and other factors. The model can also predict the fatality of crash based on the primary cause of crash and the vehicle involved in the crash.
